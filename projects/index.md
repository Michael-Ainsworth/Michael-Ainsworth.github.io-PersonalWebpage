#### Twitter Hate Speech Detection

Machine learning project using natural language processing (NLP) to identify and flag hate speech in open source Twitter data. This project was completed in a small group. The goal of this project was to develop a reliable pipeline for detecting such hate speech, while simultaneously considering the ethical implications of such a model. Various NLP techniques were utilized, including TFIDF vectorizers, GloVe embeddings, and pretrained character embeddings. Overall, the project provided relevant experience in ethical machine learning and analyzing fairness in binary classification problems.

Tools used:

* Python
* NLTK
* Scikit-learn
* GloVe
* PyTorch

#### Teleoperated Robotic Arm

Biomedical engineering instrumentation project aimed at creating a tele-operated robotic arm for remote palpation. This project was completed in a small group under the supervision of Dr. Nitish Thakor at Johns Hopkins University. The project utilizes Madgwick sensor fusion algorithms on IMU sensors to calculate end-effector position of a UR5 robotic arm. A custom end-effector was built with 3D printing to simulate a human hand. This hand utilizes silicon lining and flexible tactile sensors to model recent soft robotic technology. In addition, thermistors were used to calculate end-effector temperature. Both pressure and temperature readings were visualized through an intuitive GUI. The user controls the robotic arm through an IMU glove that communicates with the UR5 using Bluetooth.

Tools used:

* MATLAB
* Arduino
* Python
* Robot Sensors and Actuators
* ROS Simulation of UR5 Robot

#### Spotify Playlist Recommender Model

Data science project designed to generate unique playlist recommendations utilizing the Spotify API. This project was completed independently to practice API usage, to learn more about content-based recommender models, and to create a reliable method for finding new music. I pulled publicly available data on playlists and song metrics, and used the Spotify API to upload and filter my own playlists. Feature engineering was used to clean data and build playlist vectors, which could be compared to existing song metrics via cosine similarity.

Tools used:

* Spotify API
* Python

#### NBA Data Mining

Exploratory data mining project using open source National Basketball Association (NBA) data. The goal of this project was to use various classification techniques to assess a teams playoff chances using NBA data from 2010-2020. The project focused on assessing the importance of "superstar" players to a teams success using key statistics, such as VORP. The final classifiers were able to accurately predict playoff chances based on a set number of top performing players, while highlighting interesting trends regarding the importance of commonly used statistics.

Tools used:

* Python
* Tensorflow
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas

#### EOG Wheelchair

Medical Device project aimed at creating a prototype of an electric wheelchair for quadriplegic individuals. The acceleration, deceleration, and directional control were all synced to an electrooculogram (EOG) circuit. This allowed the patient full wheelchair control using only the biopotentials generated from the human eye.

Tools used:

* Arduino
* Medical device circuit design
* 3D-printing
